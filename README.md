This app provides a database and web interface for users to:

Allow users to upload photos and use the imbedded gps data to map the locations they have taken picutes.  This is not intended to be a full webstore product. It is a sample only.



This app was built with a rails back end and a React-Redux Frontend.

This repo has a companion for the back end located at: https://github.com/TrevorSeitz/location-manager-backend
Make sure to download both!

The front end is started by running npm start in the folder that the repo is in. This will start the server on port 3000.
The back end is started by running rails s -p 4000 in the folder that the repo is in. This will start the server on port 4000.

All information is saved locally on the rails server.
